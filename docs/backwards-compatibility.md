# `monkey` Backwards Compatibility

TODO

`monkey` releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/FuzzyMonkeyCo/monkey/releases).

Failing tests are guaranteed to always be generatable by FuzzyMonkey. `monkey` follows a continuous release process which may add new features.
Running failing tests with an old seed will first try to reproduce the issue then try and reproduce it with the newer tools that `monkey` offers. SEEEEEEEE updating-monkey.md
