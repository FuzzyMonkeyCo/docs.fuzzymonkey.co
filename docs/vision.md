# FuzzyMonkey Vision

> Any software developer can efficiently test and verify the correctness of projects of any size or complexity, with tooling that's easy to adopt and extend.

TODO

software is broken

lead-in to testing is often high, so high that many projects out there lack resources in this area

crucial software is exploitable, often through its own means (a "weird" call sequence)

formal methods and QuickCheck are extremely powerful: both simple and effective
